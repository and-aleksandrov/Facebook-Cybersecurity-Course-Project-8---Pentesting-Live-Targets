# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

<b>Vulnerability #1:</b> <u>Username Enumeration </u> <br /> 
The developer made a mistake while designing the span class for error messages. When random username and a random password is used, the response will contain classs called "failure":
```html
<span class="failure">Log in was unsuccessful.</span>
```
While when the existing username and random password is being used, the response will use different class - "failed" (which makes the output <b>bold</b>):
```html
<span class="failed">Log in was unsuccessful.</span>
```

<b>Vulnerability #2:</b> Cross-Site Scripting <br />
Contact Us page on the green web site has xss vulnarability. Just enter the code in the feedback field and submit. 
```html
<script>alert('Andrey found the XSS!');</script>
```
When admin will visit the feedback page, the code will be triggered
