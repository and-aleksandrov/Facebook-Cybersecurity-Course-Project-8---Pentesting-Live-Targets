# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

<b>Vulnerability #1:</b> <u>SQL Injection</u> <br /> 
When we go to the Salespeople page on the Blue web site and click View to see the details, we can notice that the address have the following format:
```html
https://130.211.197.112/blue/public/staff/salespeople/show.php?id=5
```
we can inject the following sql code ```html ' OR SLEEP(5)=0--' ``` to see if it's injectable
```html
https://130.211.197.112/blue/public/staff/salespeople/show.php?id=' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'
```
We can notice the delay of the database, so our sql code was executed. Also if we just set ' as id we will get the "database query failed" message

<b>Vulnerability #2:</b> Cross-Site Scripting <br />
Contact Us page on the green web site has xss vulnarability. Just enter the code in the feedback field and submit. 
```html
<script>alert('Andrey found the XSS!');</script>
```
When admin will visit the feedback page, the code will be triggered

## Green

<b>Vulnerability #1:</b> <u>Username Enumeration </u> <br /> 
The developer made a mistake while designing the span class for error messages. When random username and a random password is used, the response will contain classs called "failure":
```html
<span class="failure">Log in was unsuccessful.</span>
```
While when the existing username and random password is being used, the response will use different class - "failed" (which makes the output <b>bold</b>):
```html
<span class="failed">Log in was unsuccessful.</span>
```

<b>Vulnerability #2:</b> Cross-Site Scripting <br />
Contact Us page on the green web site has xss vulnarability. Just enter the code in the feedback field and submit. 
```html
<script>alert('Andrey found the XSS!');</script>
```
When admin will visit the feedback page, the code will be triggered
 
<kbd><img src="xss.gif" width="800" ></kbd>


## Red

<b>Vulnerability #1:</b> <u>Insecure Direct Object Reference</u> <br /> 
When we go to the "Find a Salesperson" page on the Red web site and click on any name to see the details, we can notice that the address have the following format:
```html
https://130.211.197.112/red/public/salesperson.php?id=1
```
ids for the salespeople presented on the website are numbers that starts from 1. If we use number 10 as an id:
```html
https://130.211.197.112/red/public/salesperson.php?id=10
```
We can see the information of a new salesperson Testy McTesterson that are not public yet.
On the other sites when you change the id to 10, instead of the hidden information you go back to the page Find a Salesperson

<b>Vulnerability #2:</b> Cross-Site Scripting <br />
Contact Us page on the green web site has xss vulnarability. Just enter the code in the feedback field and submit.

When admin will visit the feedback page, the code will be triggered
