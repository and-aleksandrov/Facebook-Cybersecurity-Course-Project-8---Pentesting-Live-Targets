# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

<b>Vulnerability #1:</b> Username Enumeration <br /> 
The developer made a mistake while designing the span class for error messages. When random username and a random password is used, the response will contain:
```html
<span class="failure">Log in was unsuccessful.</span>
```
While when the existing username and random password is being user, the response will use different class:
```html
<span class="failed">Log in was unsuccessful.</span>
```
